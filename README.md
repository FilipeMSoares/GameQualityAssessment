The code_pac folder contains python 2.7 code files including executables to launch some graphical user interfaces that allow viewing data.

The main application folder must be in PYTHONPATH to launch the GUI files.

Ubuntu:
---------
Within code_pac folder

PYTHONPATH=$(dirname \`pwd\`) python groupViewGui.py

OR

PYTHONPATH=$(dirname \`pwd\`) python DesafioGameGui.py
